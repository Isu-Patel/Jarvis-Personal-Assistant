# Jarvis - Your Personal Python Assistant

Jarvis is a simple yet extensible personal assistant written in Python. It's designed to automate common tasks, provide information, and interact with your computer using voice commands (optional).  Think of it as your own personalized digital helper.

## Features

* **Voice Control (Optional):**  Use voice commands to interact with Jarvis (requires additional libraries like `speech_recognition` and `pyttsx3`).
* **Task Automation:** Automate repetitive tasks like opening applications, searching the web, sending emails, or managing files.
* **Information Retrieval:** Get quick access to information from the web, like weather updates, news headlines, or Wikipedia summaries.
* **Customizable Commands:** Easily add your own custom commands and functionalities to tailor Jarvis to your specific needs.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**  Jarvis is designed to work on Windows, macOS, and Linux (with some platform-specific adjustments potentially needed).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* Required Libraries:  Install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
